Note the following:</p><ul><li>There&#39;s a new header file, <code>duk_config.h</code>, which must be in the include path. A default duk_config.h file, compatible with Duktape 1.2, is present in dist src/ and src-separate/ directories.</li><li>Duktape.modLoaded internal format has changed as a result of module.exports support. This should not matter unless you need to interact with Duktape.modLoaded directly for some reason.</li><li>Behavior for a CommonJS module load error has changed: the offending module is now de-registered instead of a partial module being cached. This allows calling code to retry the failing <code>require()</code> call.</li><li>DUK_OPT_DEEP_C_STACK has been removed and Duktape defaults to deep stacks on all platforms. There are explicit C stack options for (rare) platforms with a shallow stack (e.g. DUK_USE_NATIVE_CALL_RECLIMIT, DUK_USE_COMPILER_RECLIMIT).</li><li>Debugger breakpoint triggering behavior has changed so that breakpoints are only triggered when execution enters the exact breakpoint line. Breakpoints on lines without any executable code are ignored.</li><li>Some example files have been renamed. For example, <code>examples/debug-trans-socket/duk_debug_trans_socket.*</code> have been renamed to <code>examples/debug-trans-socket/duk_trans_socket.*</code>.</li></ul><p>There are bug fixes and other minor behavioral changes which may affect some applications, see <code>RELEASES.rst</code> for details.</p><h2 id="known-issues" tabindex="-1">Known issues <a class="header-anchor" href="#known-issues" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Known issues&quot;">​</a></h2><p>This release has the following known issues worth noting.</p><h3 id="ecmascript-features" tabindex="-1">ECMAScript features <a class="header-anchor" href="#ecmascript-features" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;ECMAScript features&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li>Non-compliant behavior for array indices near 2G or 4G elements.</li><li>RegExp parser is strict and won&#39;t accept some real world RegExps which are technically not compliant with ECMAScript E5/E5.1 specification.</li><li>Final mantissa bit rounding issues in the internal number-to-string conversion.</li></ul><h3 id="portability-and-platforms" tabindex="-1">Portability and platforms <a class="header-anchor" href="#portability-and-platforms" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Portability and platforms&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li>On some older clang/llvm versions (e.g. Clang 3.3 on FreeBSD 10): when <code>-m32</code> is used, Duktape will end up using the 8-byte packed value representation but clang will generate incorrect code for union assignment (see <code>misc/clang_aliasing.c</code>). The issue can be detected by defining <code>DUK_OPT_SELF_TESTS</code>. A workaround is to avoid packed types in this case by defining <code>DUK_OPT_NO_PACKED_TVAL</code>.</li><li>On some older clang/llvm versions (e.g. Clang 3.3 on FreeBSD 10): compilation may produce a warning &quot;generic selections are a C11-specific feature&quot;. The warning should be harmless.</li><li>On some older clang/llvm versions (e.g. Clang 3.3 on FreeBSD 10): harmless compilation warning for &quot;duk_repl_isinf&quot; being unused.</li><li>On some GCC versions and compilation options you may get a warning &quot;variable idx_func might be clobbered by longjmp or vfork [-Wclobbered]&quot;. This warning seems spurious and causes no known problems.</li><li>GCC <code>-O4</code> may produce a warning &quot;assuming signed overflow does not occur when assuming that (X - c) &gt; X is always false&quot; for some assertions. This warning seems spurious and causes no known problems.</li><li>GCC <code>-pedantic</code> without <code>-std=c99</code> causes the <code>unsigned long long</code> type to be used by Duktape, and an associated warning about the type. This is harmless and most easily fixed by simply using <code>-std=c99</code>.</li><li>MSVC <code>/Wp64</code> produces harmless warnings when compiling for x86. The warnings are caused by 64-bit incompatible code enabled for 32-bit targets; when you actually compile for a 64-bit target, those code paths are not used so the warnings are irrelevant.</li><li>The JSON.stringify() fast path (DUK_USE_JSON_STRINGIFY_FASTPATH) assumes that &quot;%lld&quot; format specifier is correct for the &quot;unsigned long long&quot; type.</li></ul><h2 id="raw-issues-from-test-runs" tabindex="-1">Raw issues from test runs <a class="header-anchor" href="#raw-issues-from-test-runs" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Raw issues from test runs&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="api-tests" tabindex="-1">API tests <a class="header-anchor" href="#api-tests" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;API tests&quot;">​</a></h3><p>See <code>testcase-known-issues.yaml</code>:</p><pre><code>test-to-number.c: fail; 15 diff lines; known issue: number parsing bug for strings containing NUL characters (e.g. &#39;\\u0000&#39;)

test-bug-invalid-oct-as-dec: fail; 14 diff lines; known issue: V8/Rhino parse invalid octal constants as decimal values, Duktape doesn&#39;t at the moment
test-bug-json-parse-__proto__: fail; 18 diff lines; known issue: when ES6 __proto__ enabled, JSON.parse() parses &#39;__proto__&#39; property incorrectly when a specially crafted reviver is used
test-bug-numconv-1e23: fail; 10 diff lines; known issue: corner case in floating point parse rounding
test-bug-numconv-denorm-toprec: fail; 7 diff lines; known issue: in a denormal corner case toPrecision() can output a zero leading digit
test-bug-tonumber-u0000: fail; 7 diff lines; known issue: &#39;\\u0000&#39; should ToNumber() coerce to NaN, but now coerces to zero like an empty string

test-regexp-empty-quantified: fail; 15 diff lines; known issue: a suitable empty quantified (e.g. &#39;(x*)*&#39;) causes regexp parsing to terminate due to step limit
