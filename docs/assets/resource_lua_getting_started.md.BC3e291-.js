Pre-compiled Lua libraries and executables are available at LuaBinaries. Use your favorite text editor to write your Lua programs. Make sure to save your programs as plain text. If you want an IDE, try ZeroBrane Studio.</p><p>If you use Linux or macOS, Lua is either already installed on your system or there is a Lua package for it. Make sure you get the latest release of Lua (currently 5.4.6).</p><p>Lua is also quite easy to build from source, as explained below.</p><h3 id="building-from-source" tabindex="-1">Building from source <a class="header-anchor" href="#building-from-source" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Building from source&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Lua is very easy to build and install.

If you&#39;re getting a ready-made Lua package for your platform, you&#39;ll probably need the development package as well. Otherwise, just download Lua and add its source directory to your project.</p>',30)]))}const g=a(i,[["render",n]]);export{c as __pageData,g as default};
